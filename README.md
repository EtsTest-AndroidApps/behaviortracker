## Goal

Timer is a simple application helping you to track different moments of your day. If you have no
idea in which activities you spend more time or if you want to detect if you spend to much time in
an activity which is not a priority, this application can help you to reorganize your daily !

# Development goal

This application is my playground to test what I learned in Kotlin.

It's also an app which can help me to be more productive by finding when I loose time during the day
and fix this. If I can help other people with this application, to fix their time problems too,
I would be very happy ! =)
